Abstract:
We intend to create a solution to be the bridge between Singaporeans and donation, so that we are able to increase the donation rates by 5% in Singapore in the next year. We want to create an online platform that allows users to conveniently donate and spread awareness about the importance of donation. 
As the team is composed of Singaporean students, the members have first-hand understanding of the donation situation in Singapore, which will greatly help with the development of the one-stop platform web application. Previously, a survey was carried out targeting homemakers in Singapore to better understand how we could better develop the application to cater to their needs, to encourage them to be more proactive in donating

Before Pulling/Pushing code:

1.) Before starting work on new features, always pull from the latest branch, check repo, should be main branch.

2.) When pushing up code, do not push directly to main, use another branch.
